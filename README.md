# Hangman (AiCore training)

> Hangman project that I developed as part of the AiCore AI and data engineering training. Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. This is an implementation of the Hangman game where the computer extracts a random word from a pre-determined list and the user tries to guess it.

## Milestone 1

- Answer some of these questions in the next few bullet points. What have you built? What technologies have you used? Why have you used those?

- Example: The FastAPI framework allows for fast and easy construction of APIs and is combined with pydantic, which is used to assert the data types of all incoming data to allow for easier processing later on. The server is ran locally using uvicorn, a library for ASGI server implementation.
  
```python
"""Insert your code here"""
```

## Milestone 2

- Does what you have built in this milestone connect to the previous one? If so explain how. What technologies are used? Why have you used them? Have you run any commands in the terminal? If so insert them using backticks (To get syntax highlighting for code snippets add the language after the first backticks).

- Example below:

```python
"""self.list_visual = [
            '''
            __________
              |      |
              |    \ O /
              |      |
              |     /\\
            __|____
            ''',''' 
            __________
              |      |
              |      O
              |      |
              |     /\\
            __|____
            ''','''
             __________
              |      |
              |      O
              |      |
              |     /
            __|____
            ''','''
             __________
              |      |
              |      O
              |      |
              |
            __|____
            ''','''
             __________
              |      |
              |      O
              |
              |
            __|____
            ''']
```

- The above command is used to check whether the topic has been created successfully, once confirmed the API script is edited to send data to the created kafka topic. The docker container has an attached volume which allows editing of files to persist on the container. The result of this is below:

```python
"""Insert your code here"""
```

## Milestone 3

- Continue this process for every milestone, making sure to display clear understanding of each task and the concepts behind them as well as understanding of the technologies used.

- Also don't forget to include code snippets and screenshots of the system you are building, it gives proof as well as it being an easy way to evidence your experience!

## Milestone 4

The project directory, `hangman`, therefore contains two solution .py files for this task: 
- `hangman_solution.py`, 
- `hangman_solution_bonus.py`, a more polished version of `hangman_solution.py`, which dispenses with the instructions of the original file, adds comments to make the code clearer, and uses more straightforward names for the attributes and methods.
