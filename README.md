Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

The project consists of four majour milestones: 1- Ask the user for input; 2- Define all the attributes; 3- Code the logic for checking a letter; 4- Code the logic of the game.
